### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Emma! I work as a software developer for U.S. Bank, and in my spare time I like to work on small coding projects. Currently I'm making a Twitter bot that tweets artistic representations of the local weather and playing around with various Raspberry Pi projects. You can see more of my work and get in touch via my [portfolio site](https://emmajuettner.com). Thanks for visiting!
