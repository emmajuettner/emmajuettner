### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Emma! I'm a programmer, both professionally (working on backend payment systems for U.S. Bank) and for fun (mostly making generative art). Most of my personal coding projects live on this github account, and you can also find me at my [website](https://emmajuettner.com). Thanks for visiting!
